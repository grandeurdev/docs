# RestAPI

You need three credentials to use the REST API for anything:

1. API Key 
2. Secret
3. Personal Access Token

All endpoints work on the POST method only. GET, UPDATE, DELETE, or any other endpoints return 400 error.

All requests are sent with `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Usage

```jsx
fetch("https://api.grandeur.dev<ENDPOINT_PATH>?apiKey=<APIKEY>",
	{
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/json"
			"gt-otp": SECRET
			Authorization: TOKEN
		}
		body: BODY
	}
);
```

This is how each section could look like:

## **/projects/meta**

### Body:

`{ apiKey: string }`

### Success response:

`{ code: "PROJECTS-FETCHED", message: "Project is successfully fetched", nProjects: 10 }`

### Error response:

- `{ code: "APIKEY-INVALID", message: "Your API Key seems unfamiliar." }`
- `{ code: "SIGNATURE-INVALID" }`
- `{ code: "AUTH-UNAUTHORIZED" }`

### Usage:
