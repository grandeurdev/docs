# Installation

## Arduino

1. You can search for Grandeur in Arduino's library manager. In Arduino IDE, open `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` and install Grandeur from there.

2. You can also download the latest release of Arduino SDK from [here](https://github.com/grandeurdev/arduino-sdk/releases/tag/1.0.6) and install it in your Arduino IDE.

This is how you can include `Grandeur` in your Arduino sketch:

```cpp
#include <Grandeur.h>
```

When you include `<Grandeur.h>` in your sketch, a global object grandeur is created right away which you can use to give the SDK your project's API Key and your device access token so it can start connecting with Grandeur.

## Python

You can install Py SDK using python's pip.

```bash
pip install grandeur
```

This is how you can import the Py SDK in your `.py` sketch on your RaspberryPi device.

```py
import grandeur.device as grandeur
```
