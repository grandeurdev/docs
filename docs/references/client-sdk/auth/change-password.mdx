# changePassword

This method is very similar to the forgot password feature. But unlike forgot password, here it is important for a user to be logged into his account first. To ensure the security of a user account, we send a verification code to the phone number associated with user account and return you a confirmation method.

Change password function accepts the following arguments


| Name          | Type        |   Description   |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------:     |  
| password      |    string   |   should be minimum six character long |

This method returns the following code in form of promise

**PHONE-CODE-SENT**

verification code sent to phone number
and you use the confirmation method returned
in the response of promise to verify the user.

**DATA-INVALID**

data format is invalid

**AUTH-UNAUTHORIZED**

user is required to be logged in

**PHONE-CODE-SENDING-FAILED**

failed to send code to phone number

**confirm(code)**

After submitting change password request, we send a verification code to the phone number associated with the user's accounts. As a result, we also return you a confirmation function, so that you could proceed with the change password operation after prompting the user about the verification code.

This function receives a single argument as illustrated below

## Parameters

| Name       | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| code      |    string    | six digit long numeric code|

Upon execution, this method returns the following code in the form of promise

**AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED**

password has been updated

**PHONE-CODE-INVALID**

verification code is invalid

**PHONE-CODE-VERIFICATION-FAILED**

failed to verify the verification code

**AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATE-FAILED**

failed to update the profile

Use of changePassword method has been illustrated in the example below


```js
// Variable to hold the confirmChangePassword
// method so that it could be used afterwards
var confirm = null;

// Get user data from the inputs and
// Submit request to the server
auth.changePassword(password).then((res) => {
  // Got the response
  // So checkout the response code
  switch(res.code) {
    case "PHONE-CODE-SENT": 
      // Verification code has been sent
      confirm = res.confirm;
  }
})

// After getting response from change password request
// Prompt the user about the verification code
// and submit it to server with the confirm method
confirm(code).then((res) => {
  // Got the response
  switch(res.code) {
    case "AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED":
        // Password has been updated
  }
});
```
