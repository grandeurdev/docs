# Introduction

Building a smart (IoT) device is an art because it is about unifying the physical world with the digital one. When you put a piece of hardware on the web, magic happens, but dealing with a single device is one thing, and forging an automated ecosystem with tens and thousands of these devices is another. Creating that sort of magic isn't without it's challenges:

- Huge development stack: your hardware, your app (web or mobile), your communication broker, your database, and the communication between all of these.
- Your database design and management.
- Setting up and maintaining your servers handling your compute, storage, and networking.
- Web development â€“ backend of your server, frontend of your web apps.
- Your hardware design and assembly itself.
- Scaling your system up to hundreds of thousands of devices as your business grows.

We have been through all of these challenges ourselves, and built a set of tools so we don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over again for every new project. And we packaged all the powerful tools in a platform so it's not just us cherishing the benefits of faster and more reliable development.

You can visualize Grandeur as an IoT platform, made up of a powerful set of tools, best practices, and a development experience that makes the otherwise very complex IoT projects no-brainer. You should give it a try if you do not want to worry about the backend of your next big thing and focus on what's more important to you, your project and your business.

Our goal with Grandeur is to make prototyping IoT projects quick with tools like OTA and nocode dashboard/app builder. without losing the flexibility and the scope of things you can build with it.

Grandeur is product-centred. It is much more than just a medium of communication between your app and your hardware device. Focusing on expediting IoT product development, it offers an ecosystem of the most necessary tools integrated to make the most head-cracking development problems seamless.

## Here's a problem we can learn from

Youâ€™re planning to start an autonomous food delivery startup and but you have quite a few apprehensions regarding it. You are averse to the idea of underpaid labour and want to solve this problem through a tech-efficient drone-delivery service. Youâ€™ve seen other food delivery systems where orders are misplaced or delivered to the wrong customer. Thereâ€™ve also been quite a few occurrences of food gone spoilt due to unsuitable conditions. Keeping all of this under consideration, you want to build a delivery box with a digital locking mechanism which can only be opened by an OTP the customer will add once the order is delivered and a temperature sensor so that optimum temperature can be maintained for the food. Youâ€™re already burdened by the responsibility of actually getting the food setup ready and these problems are bugging you. How will you get such a platform ready?

If you take things forward in a conventional manner,you'll need multiple engineers to work on frontend, backend, database, API development and building SDKâ€™s like android, web and hardware etc, thus not only the estimated cost will turn out be a hefty sum but the development cycle will be time-consuming creating a hurdle to put the idea into production phase. Typically it takes a business idea like this about one year from the initial idea to product launch and their first paying customers if things go smoothly.

This is where `Grandeur` comes in, a tech-smart and cost optimal solution for all of your back-end problems.

You need a bridge between the drones and the cloud, Grandeur provides the communication network. You need to authenticate your users, Grandeur has the auth feature in it which could provide you with the OTP to open the delivery box. You need an online storage space to store your user's details, it comes with builtin support for storage. You need a database to store remote monitoring logs so that the rider can monitor the temperature of the food, it provides a cloud datastore service.

So what you essentially have to do is register for the platform, create a project and start integrating your apps and hardware with the SDK. Then finally you registered your products to the platform and quickly go into the production phase. With minimal engineering time, your apps can be live on the store quickly. Grandeur also provides simple pricing plans for your requirements and little to no maintenance means cutting down your operations cost exponentionally. Everything you build is secure and scalable.

In the long run, you can became a major disruptor to the current business model of food-delivery and distribution with your competitive advantage of cost reduction, efficiency increase and enhanced safety measures.
