# Grafana 

We have integrated REST API into Grandeur, which helps us connect to a lot of new platforms and so much more. 

**Lets talk about the possibilities!**

This opens up a lot of doors with applications like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). With Grafana, you can create beautiful visualizations and dashboards that help you understand your data in new ways. 

Here is an example of what you can do with it. For instance you want to obtain a list of all the devices you have in your project. With REST it is just an API call away using the route /devices/get.
This is how:

```js
res = await fetch("https://api.grandeur.dev/devices/get?apiKey=<APIKEY>",
	{
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/json"
			"gt-otp": SECRET
			Authorization: TOKEN
		}
		body: {
            "type": "paired",
		        "filter": "online",
            "productID": ""
        }
	}
);

console.log(res) 
// This is the response which will be returned 
// code: "DEVICES-LIST-FETCHED",
// message: "List of requested devices is successfully fetched.",
// nDevices: devices.length,
// devices: devices
```

Let us visualise this in the actual tool itself. 

1. Sign in to your Grafana account or create one if you do not have it.

2. Add your Grafana Cloud Stack and launch your instance to get your workspace all set up. 
<ReactPlayer playing controls volume={0} width={832} height={468} url="/demos/grafana/add-instance.webm" />

3. Now choose your data source and install it. We will work with JSON API. 
JSON API is an open source data source plugin for Grafana that lets you visualize data from any URL that returns JSON, such as REST APIs.

4. Create your JSON API data source to get working. 

<ReactPlayer playing controls volume={0} width={832} height={468} url="/demos/grafana/json-api.webm" />

5. Update the settings and add your Grandeur Credentials so that you can retrieve data. 
Click explore in the end to open your query editor.
<ReactPlayer playing controls volume={0} width={832} height={468} url="/demos/grafana/grandeur-cred.webm" />

6.We are now going to configure our query editor . [Here](https://grafana.github.io/grafana-json-datasource/query-editor) is where you can get all the details regarding it. 
We can display the data of our choice through multiple fields.

<ReactPlayer playing controls volume={0} width={832} height={468} url="/demos/grafana/query-editor.webm" />

7. Now create a dashboard. 

Usecase Scenario:
Create a button switch on your canvas. [This](https://docs.grandeur.dev/quickstart/hello-world-with-iot) is what we are talking about. Now we can visualise real time updates of our data as we switch our button on and off.

We will be using the route device/data/get:
