# Getting Started

To use Grandeur in our project, let's first set it up.

<Steps>

### Sign up on Grandeur

Go to https://console.grandeur.dev

- Click on get access to get redirected to the registration page. Add the required credentials and click Submit.
- You'd receive a one-time-password (OTP) on your phone. Enter it and click Submit.
- Congratulations! Your account is created.

### Create a Project

A [project](/guides/project/managing-a-project.mdx) is the first thing you need to create to start working with Grandeur. A project is like a namespace, a completely isolated network of users and devices, along with a separate datastore. This is essentially the playground for the developer.

- Click on New Project button.
- Fill in the name and description of the project and click Create Project button. Your project will be created.

### Register your Device

When you register a [device](/guides/devices/data.mdx), you make it available in your project's network. It is meant to securely connect devices to cloud.

To register a new device, just type a preferably unique name for your device and click enter. A dialog box will give you your device's unique ID and token that you can copy and then use later in your device code for connecting with the internet.

</Steps>

Now that we are done with setting up our environment, lets [move on](/quickstart/hello-world-with-iot.mdx) to building our first hardware device.
