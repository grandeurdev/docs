# Datastore

Data storage is the basic requirement of a data driven application or device. We have build this feature in order to enable users to store large amount of data like logs of devices. To access this feature simply get a reference to the storage class by calling datastore() method with the project object. This is illustrated as below

```js
// Get reference to the datastore class
// by calling the datastore method
var datastore = project.datastore();
```

Datastore of Grandeur is based on no-sql/document based database model. So you can store documents (as knonw as records in sql) into various collections (as known as tables in sql). The document is based on JSON datastructure. Methods of this class are documented in following sections
