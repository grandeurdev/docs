# collection.delete

This method can be used to delete a document from a collection. It accepts a json object which specifies the match condition and returns the count of total deleted documents. It accepts following arguments

| Name       | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| filter        |    object    | a json object which specifies the match condition of documents|

It is important to note here that running this function without specifying the match condition will result in deletion of all the documents of a collection.

This method returns following codes

**DATA-INVALID**

collection name wasn't specified while getting the reference

**DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-NOT-FOUND**

not even a single document qualified the match condition so delete count is zero

**DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETED**

deleted the matched documents

**DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETION-FAILED**

failed to delete the documents

The usage of this method is illustrated in the example below


```js
// This method can be used in many ways

// Case: delete a specific document by providing
// the document id, you can use this on other 
// attributes as well
collection.delete({documentID: "id"}).then((res) => {
  // Got response from server
  switch(res.code) {
    case "DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETED": 
      // Method returns the count
      // should be exactly 1 here
      console.log(res.deletedCount);
  }
});

// Case: delete multiple but specific documents
// Define an array of ids of documents required to
// be deleted, you can use this on other 
// attributes as well
var documentIDs = ["1", "2", "3"];

// Run operation with $in operator
collection.delete({documentID: {$in: documentIDs}}).then((res) => {
  // Got response from server
  switch(res.code) {
    case "DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETED": 
      // Method returns the count
      // should match the length of the array
      console.log(res.deletedCount);
  }
});

// Case: delete in range
// Run operation with $lt and $gt operator on attributes
collection.delete({voltage: {$lt: 25, $gt: 30}}).then((res) => {
  // Got response from server
  switch(res.code) {
    case "DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETED": 
      // Method returns the count
      console.log(res.deletedCount);
  }
});

// Case: delete all
// Run operation with $in operator
collection.delete().then((res) => {
  // Got response from server
  switch(res.code) {
    case "DATASTORE-DOCUMENTS-DELETED": 
      // Method returns the count
      console.log(res.deletedCount);
  }
});
```
