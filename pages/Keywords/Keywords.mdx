# Keywords

**Grandeur** - A single spot solution for all your IoT product problems. ✔

**Auth Token-** When a user logs in, an Auth token is returned. This token along with the API Key, being sent with every request, is what validates the authority of the request.

**Access Token**- An integral part of your access credentials. Access tokens allow and limit, at the same time, the access to user and device scopes. 

**API Key -** Grandeur gives you the API key of your project that your device is registered in. An API key is used to identify and authenticate an application, user, or device, by telling Grandeur which project the application, user, or device, are requesting to access.

**Callback-** A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. This technique allows a function to call another function. A callback function can run after another function has finished. In our platform, it mostly serves as an update handler for the device variable.

**DeviceId:** Listed in the Devices Section. Each device that communicates with the cloud needs to have a unique ID which is used whenever you communicate to your device from your app.

**JSON -** It is a text-based way of representing JavaScript object literals, arrays, and scalar data. JSON is relatively easy to read and write, while also easy for software to parse and generate. You can store your data in JSON format.

**Path-**You can get/set data’s individual key by specifying the path in slash notation. For instance, if you have stored `{temperature: { celsius: 10, fahrenheit: 7}}, humidity: 1}`, then you can access the temperature and humidity by providing humidity and temperature.celsius respectively in the path argument.

**Promise- Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.***

**SDK-** A software development toolkit is a set of software tools and programs that you developers can use to build applications for specific platforms. Right now Grandeur has 6 device and app SDK’s available for different boards and languages, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Javascript, NodeJS, Python, Android, etc.
