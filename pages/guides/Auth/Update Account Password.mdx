# Update Account Password 


A user has to be necessarily logged into the account to update the password. To ensure the security of a user account, we send a verification code to the phone number associated with user account and return you a confirmation method. After submitting a change password request, the user receives a confirmation code to the associated phone number to proceed with the update process. 

Use of changePassword method has been illustrated in the example below

```js
// Get user data from the inputs and
// Submit request to the server
auth.changePassword(password).then((res) => {
  // Handle the response
})
```
