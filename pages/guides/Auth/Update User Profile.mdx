### ****auth.updateProfile(displayName, displayPicture, phone)****

A user profile gets automatically created whenever you register a new user account. This makes it really easy for a developer to handle data specific to user. Like you can setup display picture of a user. Which allows you present a unique experience to each user. This is why Grandeur has added this method with which you can update the profile of an authenticated user.

All the arguments are required. It is important to note that if you execute this method with an updated phone number or in other words if a user tried to update the phone number associated with the account, then we validate the new number first by automatically sending a verification code and will return you a confirmation method in response.

Use of updateProfile method has been illustrated in the example below

```


// Get user data from the inputs and
// Submit request to the server
auth.updateProfile(displayName, displayPicture, phone).then((res) => {
  // Handle the Response
})


```
