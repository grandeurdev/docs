# Register a New User


****auth.register(email, password, displayName, phone)****

The first step to accessing any platform is signing up on it. This method allows you to add new users to your project through SDK. To create a new user account, simply provide the user email, password, display name and phone number as an argument to this function. Registering a new user account with SDK involves verification from our side to protect you from bogus users. So when you execute this function, Grandeur automatically sends a verification code to the phone number provided in the argument and returns you a promise so you can access the confirmation method.

Account registration has been illustrated in the example below


```js
// Get user data from the inputs and
// Submit request to the server
auth.register(email, password, displayName, phone).then((res) => {
  // Handle Response
})
```

# Creating a New User Account

To control the device from the app, you'll need a user account. After your user account is made, make sure you pair it with your device.

# Deleting a User Account

Once you are done with operating a particular user account, you can delete it from your platform to add a new user or give the device access to a new one.
