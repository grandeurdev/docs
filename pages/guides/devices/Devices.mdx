# Overview

The device entity ultimately defines two things:

- Which hardware devices a user can control.
- What kind of data a hardware device can access in your namespace

Device management essentially falls under the device class. This class provides access to the features associated to device. Simply get a reference to the device class by calling `devices()` method with the project object. This is illustrated as below

```js
// Get reference to the devices class
// by calling the device method
var devices = project.devices();
```

Now once you got the reference to the devices class, you can simply use all the features by calling the respective methods. Features include pairing a device, unpairing a device and getting or setting device meta data.
