# About topics

A device can only subscribe to its own topic. For an app, it must specify which device it wants to subscribe to. That's why every topic must start with a [device ID](/guides/access-credentials/device-id-token) like `"devicelfdzibp1qwso0jj7blg4a407/state"{:js}` otherwise Grandeur will return an `TOPIC-INVALID` error.

Apart from this, keep the following things in mind as well to avoid unexpected errors:

1. You cannot leave the topic string empty.
2. A topic does not start or end with a forward slash (`/`).
3. Topic cannot have an empty level either like `"device//data"{:js}`.
