# Retool

Retool is a software development platform that allows people to create custom tools, applications, and workflows without needing to write code from scratch. 
It simplifies the process of building user interfaces and connecting to various data sources, making it easier for individuals or teams to build internal tools for their specific needs.

To connect Grandeur with Retool you have to choose RESTQuery(restapi) as a data source and you are good to go. 

## Basic Setup

Press the **Create New** button and select **App**

Choose **RESTQuery(restapi)** as **resource**.

Choose the action type as POST and then fill in the **URL field** with `https://api.grandeur.tech` followed by the path or endpoint you want to send the request to. 
You can find a [list of all endpoints here](/references/rest-api)
For example, to list all your devices registered in your project and their details, you will use `devices/get`.

In **URL Parameters**, add your **API key** from [Grandeur console's Access](https://console.grandeur.dev/access) page.

In the **Headers** field, add the **Authorization** header and put your **Auth token** in it. To generate an **Auth token** for Grafana, go to [Grandeur console's Access](https://console.grandeur.dev/access) tab.

Click **Save and Run** and you can see a complete response in the response section.

## Querying

Queries can be filtered to obtain the desired response. Enable the **transformer** to achieve that.

In this case we are querying for only 
four parameters ; ID,name,status and pairing status using the following code:

`return data.devices.map(device => ({id: device.deviceID, name: device.name, status: device.status, paired:device.paired}));`

Click **Save and Run** to run your query and you will see only requested parameters in the response.

## Visualisation

Use the multiple components Retool offers for better visualization. In this case we'll be using a **table** to visualise our response. 

Drag and drop a table from the **components list** on the right.

Use the **preview icon** to view your app in the other mode. 

You can also **refresh your table** to display the desired results. 

Customise your component/app by using the **styles** option.
