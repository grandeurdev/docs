# Device ID and Token

Just like the API key is your project identifier, the Device ID is your device identifier where each device gets a unique device id
in the form of _devicelg0lej2u4x490ijkgkq82okq_. The deivce token then acts as your password/access card which you
use to tell the server that you have access to control the device. It can also be used to revoke access to particular 
devices in the future or change access levels of a particular user.
