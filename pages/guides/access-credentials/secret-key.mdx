# Secret Key

Grandeur generates a secret key which acts acts as a security layer for custom apps. You pass it in your app credentials to gain complete access. Albeit not unique to each app it acts an extra layer of security as it is not transferred over the wire. 

This is how the global project scope is distributed among the smaller entities and we make sure that everyone gets what they are allowed to access.

 ```js
      // With global Grandeur object, you can simply initialize 
      // the SDK with your API and Secret key
      var project = grandeur.init("YOUR-APIKEY", "SECRET-KEY");
    ```
