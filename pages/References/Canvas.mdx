# Canvas

Grandeur Canvas is an imperative addition to the Grandeur family. It is a prototyping tool that lets you drag and drop widgets — like buttons, sliders, displays, and graphs — to sketch a layout which you can use instead of coding a full app. This means you do not have to have app designers in your team before starting to build IoT — a single hardware engineer is a beast with Grandeur.

Once you’ve added a widget you need to configure it. You have to be careful while naming the variable similar to the device side variable so that they can communicate with each other. Once configured, you run the widget after choosing the device.

-**Button**
Make buttons and control other services with a single tap. The button widget toggles the status of yoour chosen variable.

-**Slider**
 When the state of the slider changes over a specified range, the widget calls the onChanged callback and updates its status accordingly. 

-**Display** 
A screen to display the current status of any of your chosen variable.

-**Progress** 
Displays the current progress over a certain range. For example 

-**Graph** 
The Chart widget displays quantitative attributes from a data source as a graphical representation. It allows end users to visualize and observe possible patterns and trends from raw data.
