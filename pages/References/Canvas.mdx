# Canvas

Grandeur Canvas is an imperative addition to the Grandeur family. It is a prototyping tool that lets you drag and drop widgets — like buttons, sliders, displays, and graphs — to sketch a layout which you can use instead of coding a full app. This means you do not have to have app designers in your team before starting to build IoT — a single hardware engineer is a beast with Grandeur.

Once you’ve added a widget you need to configure it. You have to be careful while naming the variable similar to the device side variable so that they can communicate with each other. Once configured, you run the widget after choosing the device.

-**Button**
Make buttons and control other services with a single tap. The button widget toggles the status of yoour chosen variable.

-**Slider**
 When the state of the slider changes over a specified range, the widget calls the onChanged callback and updates its status accordingly. 

-**Display** 
A screen to display the current status of any of your chosen variable.

-**Progress** 
Displays the current progress over a certain range. For example 

-**Graph** 
The Chart widget displays quantitative attributes from a data source as a graphical representation. It allows end users to visualize and observe possible patterns and trends from raw data.

Resize Widgets
Right after the widget is placed on the canvas, you will see small green handlebars. They indicate in which direction the widget can be resized. Tap and hold the handlebar to resize the widget.
To enable resizing again, tap and hold the widget until it pops up a bit, then release it. Handlebars will appear again.
Each widget has its max height and width. You can't go over these limits.
Move Widgets
Tap and hold on the widget until it pops up a bit. 
Drag it anywhere you need. Release the finger when done.
If there is no room for the widget at the destination, it will return to the initial position.
Duplicate Widgets
Tap and hold any widget until it pops up a bit. 
The header of the app will change and you will see the Duplucate icon. 
Drag the widget to the Duplicate area untill its duplicated. 
Clone of the widget will be placed on the next available place. You might need to scroll down to see where it landed.
