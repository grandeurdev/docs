#JS-Initialization

The installation package gives access to the global `Grandeur` object, through which you can initialize the SDK and get a reference to your project as shown below


```
// With global Grandeur object,
// you can simply initialize the SDK 
// with your API key and get reference 
// to your project
var project = grandeur.init("YOUR-APIKEY", "ACCESS-KEY", "ACCESS-TOKEN");
```
