#Initialization

Initialization is as simple as calling grandeur.init() with your credentials (Your project's API Key and device's Access Token). The SDK uses your API key to know which project and access token to make sure the request is coming from a legit source. It then returns a Grandeur::Project object which exposes other subclasses like Device and Datastore, and you can go programming your device from there.

#include <Grandeur.h>

Grandeur::Project myProject;

```
void setup() {
  // You can initialize device configurations like this.
  myProject = grandeur.init(YourAPIKey, AccessToken);
}


void loop() {}

// **RESULT**
// Initializes the SDK's configurations and returns Project reference.
```

As soon as you call grandeur.init(), the SDK uses the configurations to start trying to connect with the your project on Grandeur. But it cannot reach Grandeur if the device is not already connected to a WiFi.
