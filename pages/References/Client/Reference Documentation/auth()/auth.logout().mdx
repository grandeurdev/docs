#auth.logout()

This method comes handy because along with logging the user in, it is also required to logout a user when required. It serves as the most basic and important feature.

This method returns the following codes upon execution

-AUTH-ACCOUNT-LOGGEDOUT

user has been logged out of his account

-AUTH-UNAUTHORIZED

user is not authenticated

-AUTH-ACCOUNT-LOGOUT-FAILED

logout operation failed

This is how you can use this method in your application

```
// Send the request to server to logout
// the authenticated user
auth.logout().then((res) => {
    // Handle response
});
```
