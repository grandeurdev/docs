**Which plan is right for me?**

If you are just starting up and want to put your idea into execution then the community plan is right for you. To get the best out of our platform, use our starter plan because it comes with generous limits at discounted rate. Starter plan is meant for production use. The starter plan automatically transitions into growth plan upon reaching consumption limit.

**Can I upgrade, downgrade or cancel anytime?**

Yes, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time. Note that we don't provide prorated refunds for downgrades or cancellations. This means that if you downgrade or cancel before the end of your billing period, you still pay for the remainder of the month.

**Is credit card required to signup?**

Nope, credit card isn't required at signup. You can connect your card after signing up through payment screen in our dashboard.

**What if I reached my plan limit?**

Once you will reach the free plan limit, you will be prompted to enter the credit card details and you will be billed as per the starter plan. You will be charged for extra resources with respect to the growth plan rates only after reaching limit of starter plan.

**Can I cap usage on growth plan?**

No, you cannot currently cap your growth plan usage. We are evaluating options for supporting caps and budget alerts on growth plan usage.

**How will the growth plan be billed?**

Growth plan includes the usage quota from starter plan and you will be charged with respect to the rate provided only for the extra consumed resources.
