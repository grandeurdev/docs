# Application

Grandeur is the entry point â€” the door of the SDK. grandeur is the global object of the Grandeur that gets available right away when you include `<Grandeur.h>` in your sketch. It has just one purpose and therefore gives you only one function: grandeur.init().

Project is the main class and all grandeur functionalities originate from it. You can safely imagine the object of Project class as a reference to your project on Grandeur. You get the object of this class when you initialize SDK's configurations using grandeur.init().
