#auth.updateProfile(displayName, displayPicture, phone)

A user profile gets automatically created whenever you register a new user account. This makes it really easy for you as a developer to handle data specific to user. Like you can setup display picture of a user. Which allows you present a unique experience to each user. This is why we have added this method with which you can update the profile of a authenticated user.

Update profile function accepts the following arguments

## Table

| Name       | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| displayPicture   |    string     |   should be a valid URL |
| displayName |     string        |   can only contains alphabets |
| phone    |    string     |  should start with country code and
cannot include spaces e.g. +923336335233 |


All the arguments are required. It is important to note that if you execute this method with an updated phone number or in other words if a user tried to update the phone number associated with the account, then we validate the new number first by automatically sending a verification code and will return you a confirmation method in response.

Update profile method returns the following code in form of promise

-PHONE-CODE-SENT

verification code sent to phone number
and you use the confirmation method returned
in the response of promise to verify the user.

-PHONE-NUMBER-INVALID

provided phone number format is invalid

-DATA-INVALID

data format is invalid

-AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED

profile has been updated

-AUTH-PROFILE-UPTODATE

data isn't modified

-AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATE-FAILED

failed to update the profile

***confirm(code)***
We are very particular about the phone number associated with the profile. This is why we validate the phone number whenever a user try to update it. As a result, we return you a confirm function so that you could proceed with the update profile operation after prompting the user about the verification code.

This function receives a single argument as illustrated below

| Name       | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| code      |    string    | six digit long numeric code|

Upon execution, this method returns the following code in form of promise

-AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED

profile has been updated

-PHONE-CODE-INVALID

verification code is invalid

-PHONE-CODE-VERIFICATION-FAILED

failed to verify the verification code

-AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATE-FAILED

failed to update the profile

Use of updateProfile method has been illustrated in the example below

```
// Variable to hold the confirmProfileUpdate
// method so that it could be used afterwards
var confirm = null;

// Get user data from the inputs and
// Submit request to the server
auth.updateProfile(displayName, displayPicture, phone).then((res) => {
  // Got the response
  // So checkout the response code
  switch(res.code) {
    case "PHONE-CODE-SENT": 
      // Verification code has been sent
      confirm = res.confirm;
      break;
    case "AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED":
      // Profile has been updated
  }
})

// After getting response from update profile request
// Prompt the user about the verification code
// and submit it to server with the confirm 
// method
confirm(code).then((res) => {
  // Got the response
  switch(res.code) {
    case "AUTH-PROFILE-UPDATED":
        // Profile has been updated
  }
});
```
