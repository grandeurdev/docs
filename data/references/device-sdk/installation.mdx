You can search for Grandeur in Arduino's library manager. In Arduino IDE, open Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries and install Grandeur from there.

You can also download the latest release of Arduino SDK from here and install it in your Arduino IDE.

### Inclusion

When you include `<Grandeur.h>` in your sketch, a global object grandeur is created right away which you can use to give the SDK your project's API Key and your device access token so it can start connecting with Grandeur (more on it in the next step).
