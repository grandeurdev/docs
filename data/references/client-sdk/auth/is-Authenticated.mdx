// Send request to the to server to check
// if user is authenticated or not
auth.isAuthenticated().then((res) => {
    // Handle the response
    switch(res.code) {
      case "AUTH-AUTHORIZED": 
        // User is authroized
        // log the user profile
        console.log(res.userProfile);
    }
});
```
