# device.data().set(path, value)

Just like get, you can also set the data of the device in similar way.

This method accepts the following arguments

| Name       | Type |   Description |
| :------------ | :---------: | ----------: |
| path     |    string    |  can be empty or a path to a key in dot notation|
| value     |    string    |  you can provide a valid value for the field that you want to update|

This method returns the following codes in response

-DEVICE-DATA-UPDATED

details has been updated

-DEVICE-DATA-UPDATE-FAILED

happens when you set value to parent.child and parent is also not an object

-DEVICE-NOT-PAIRED

device is not paired to the account

-DEVICE-ID-INVALID

-DATA-INVALID

device id is required

Use of set method has been illustrated in the example below

```
// Submit request to the server
device.data().set("voltage").then((res) => {
  // Got the response
  switch(res.code) {
    case "DEVICE-DATA-UPDATED": 
      // Device data has been updated
      console.log(res.update, res.path);
  }
})
```
