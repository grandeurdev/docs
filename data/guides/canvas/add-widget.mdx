# Managing a Widget

To add a new widget, tap on the Add Widget icon and choose the required widget from the dropdown list. 
Once youâ€™ve added a widget you need to configure it. You have to be careful while naming the variable similar to the device side variable so that they can communicate with each other. 
Once configured, you run the widget after choosing the particular device.
