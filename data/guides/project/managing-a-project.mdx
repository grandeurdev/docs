# Managing a Project

A project is the first thing you need to create to start working with Grandeur. A project is like a namespace, a completely isolated network of users and devices, along with a separate datastore. While you can create an unlimited number of projects, but no two projects can interact or share anything with one other.

Each project is identified by a digital signature that we call the API key, just as your identification card or social security number identifies you as a citizen. To connect your apps or hardware to your project's network, this is what you need to provide to the SDKs. The API key is sent with every request to Grandeur and this is what defines the project of the request.
