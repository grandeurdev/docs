# Access Credentials

**Secret Key**

Grandeur generates a secret key which acts as an imperative access credential in addition to the ApiKey. This access token along with the API Key is what authenticates the device's connection to Grandeur.

This is how the global project scope is distributed among the smaller entities and we make sure that everyone gets what they are allowed to access.
