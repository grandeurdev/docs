# Access Credentials

Grandeur generates a secret key which acts as an imperative access credential in addition to the API key. This access token along with the API Key is what authorises the device's connection to Grandeur. You pass in your app credentials to gain complete access. The secret key provides an extra layer of security as it is not transferred over wire.  

This is how the global project scope is distributed among the smaller entities and we make sure that everyone gets what they are allowed to access.

 ```js
      // With global Grandeur object, you can simply initialize 
      // the SDK with your API and Secret key
      var project = grandeur.init("YOUR-APIKEY", "SECRET-KEY");
    ```
