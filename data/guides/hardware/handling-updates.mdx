# Handling Updates From Grandeur

You can not only `get()/set()` but also subscribe to a device variable, which means if an update occurs in that variable at any time, the device will instantly get it. To subscribe to a variable, you just need to pass the variable name and a function to `device(deviceId).data().on()`. The function you pass to `device(deviceId).data().on()` is set as an update handler for that variable, which means the code inside that function will be run whenever that variable is updated.

Let's set an update handler for device voltage now:

```cpp
#include <Grandeur.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

Grandeur::Project project;
Grandeur::Project::Device device;

void setupWiFi(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Disconnecting WiFi if it"s already connected.
  WiFi.disconnect();
  // Setting it to Station mode which basically scans for nearby WiFi routers.
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  // Begin connecting to WiFi.
  WiFi.begin(SSID, Password);
  Serial.printf("\nDevice is connecting to WiFi using SSID %s and Passphrase %s.\n", ssid.c_str(), passphrase.c_str());
}

void printUpdatedVoltage(const char* path, int voltage) {
  // This function prints the new value of the voltage variable.
  Serial.printf("Updated Voltage: %d\n", voltage);
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  setupWiFi();

  project = grandeur.init(apiKey, token);
  device = myProject.device(deviceID);

  Device.data().on("voltage", printUpdatedVoltage)
}

void loop() {
  // This runs the SDK when the device WiFi is connected.
  if(WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) project.loop();
}

```
