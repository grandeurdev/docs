# Handling Connection Status with Grandeur

You can also listen on SDK's connection-related events. For example, to run some code when the device makes a successful connection to Grandeur or when the device's connection to Grandeur breaks, you can wrap that code in "a function that takes a bool and returns void" and pass it to `Grandeur::Project's onConnection()` function.

Here's how you can handle the connection event:

```cpp

#include <Grandeur.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

Grandeur::Project Project;

void setupWiFi(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Disconnecting WiFi if it"s already connected.
  WiFi.disconnect();
  // Setting it to Station mode which basically scans for nearby WiFi routers.
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  // Begin connecting to WiFi.
  WiFi.begin(YourWiFiSSID, YourWiFiPassphrase);
  Serial.printf("\nDevice is connecting to WiFi using SSID %s and Passphrase %s.\n", ssid.c_str(), passphrase.c_str());
}

void connectionCallback(bool status) {
  // This method handles the events related to device's connection with Grandeur.
  switch(status) {
    case CONNECTED:
      // If the connection event occurred.
      Serial.println("Device Connected to Grandeur!\n");
      break;
    case DISCONNECTED:
      // If the disconnection event occurred.
      Serial.println("Device Disconnected from Grandeur!\n");
      break;
  }
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // This sets up the device WiFi.
  setupWiFi();
  // You can initialize device configurations like this.
  Project = grandeur.init(YourApiKey, YourDeviceToken);
  // Setting up listener for device's connection event
  Project.onConnection(connectionCallback);
}

void loop() {
  // This runs the SDK when the device WiFi is connected.
  if(WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) myProject.loop();
}

```
