# Collections

Collections are essentially database tables where all of your information is stored.

**datastore.collection(name)**

From the datastore class, you can get a reference to a collection in order to execute a query or insert new documents into it.

```js
// Get reference to a collection
var collection = datastore.collection(name);
```

It is important to note here that it is not required for a collection to pre exist in order to get reference to it. A collection automatically gets created when you insert first document into it. 

You can execute multiple operations on a collection including insert, delete, update and search(filter).

Here's how you can perfom these operations through the dashboard.

## Insert 

This is how you can add new documents(records) in a new data collection. The user can also make multiple collections to store data.

## Delete

This is how a user can delete a pre-existing collection.

## Filter

The user can filter out meaningful data by providing the required match condition.
