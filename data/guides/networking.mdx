# Networking

We work with two communication channels in **Web SDK** 

- HTTP based REST API channel 

- Duplex based realtime API channel.

 We use the first to do some basic things like authentication or handle big requests like file uploading, while the latter, as its name suggests, for realtime communication like fetching or updating the device's data. The realtime channel is as fast as 200ms RTT. It is based on our custom protocol aka. Duplex. We do not allow any unauthenticated communication over this channel and therefore authenticate a connection over the REST channel first.

In the ***Device SDK***, we only use the realtime channel. A device cannot establish a connection over this channel unless and until its access token is validated. A device access token is provided while initialising the grandeur configurations through `grandeur.init().`
