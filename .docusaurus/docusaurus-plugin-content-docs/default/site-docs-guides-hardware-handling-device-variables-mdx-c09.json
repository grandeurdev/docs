  "description": "In IoT, every device in the network wants to publish some variables for users or other devices in the network to see. On Grandeur, we call these the data of the device. you can store the device variables as key-value pairs, like the device's voltage or current or its ON/OFF state. Keeping the online copy of device variables (aka. data) updated gives you many advantages: you can see if your device is ON or OFF at any moment just by fetching its state from Grandeur.",
