  "description": "A very important feature is to add the forgot password option into your app. This method allows you to update the password of a user account if the user is not authenticated. We validate a user with phone authentication in this case. So just prompt user about the email account associated with the account, we will automatically send the verification code the phone number associated with the profile and after which you can submit a confirmation request.",
