  "description": "To register your device, you first need to register its data model under the Models Section. Model is a way to manage and categorize devices. You can create multiple models and each model can then be associated with multiple devices. You are free to name the function whatever you want, but you have to be vigilant in the schema field while passing a variable with its value. Schema here is not strictly enforced and meant to give your device an initial state.",
