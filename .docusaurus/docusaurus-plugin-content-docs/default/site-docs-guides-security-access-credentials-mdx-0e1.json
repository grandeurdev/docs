  "description": "Grandeur generates a secret key which acts as an imperative access credential in addition to the API key. This access token along with the API Key is what authorises the device's connection to Grandeur. You pass in your app credentials to gain complete access. The secret key provides an extra layer of security as it is not transferred over wire.",
