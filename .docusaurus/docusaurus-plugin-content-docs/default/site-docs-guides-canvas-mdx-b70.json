  "description": "Canvas is an imperative addition to the Grandeur family. It is a prototyping tool that lets you drag and drop widgets — like buttons, sliders, displays, and graphs — to sketch a layout which you can use instead of coding a full app. This means you do not have to have app designers in your team before starting to build IoT — a single hardware engineer is a beast with Grandeur.",
